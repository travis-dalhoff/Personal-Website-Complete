# Personal-Website-Complete
This is my working personal website and part of the submission for my CodeLouisville project.

The primary purpose of the website is to demonstrate to potential employers my skills as a front end web developer and serve as 
a portfolio for my projects. It also has the secondary purpose of reaching out to others in the web development field for feedback
and networking opportunities.

To open the page, run travis.html. It runs best on Chrome or Firefox. There are issues with the picture flipper on about.html on 
IE.

I set Media Query break points to attempt to adjust for tablet sized screens and smart phone screens. There are additional break
points to account for the changing size of the logo in the header.

I use jQuery to hide the navigation bar and use a select/option nav menu and button on small screens.

I use Phaser, an HTML5 game framework, to run the Breakout game. Phaser can be found at https://phaser.io. The tutorial I used to 
help build the Breakout game can be found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser

If you have any questions, send me an email at tdalhoff@live.com

THANKS <code>LOUISVILLE!!!!!!!!
